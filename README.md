# Car Ambient

A full-screen ambient clock for the Geely Cityray's vertical 13" screen, with a now-playing card.

- **Themes:** Minimal, Gauge, Aurora. Swipe left or right to switch.
- **Dim:** double-tap anywhere outside the music controls.
- **Now playing:** shows title, artist and art from whichever app is playing, with previous / play-pause / next.
- Keeps the screen on, hides the system bars, and nudges the layout a few pixels each minute to avoid burn-in.

## Build

GitHub Actions builds the APK on every push. Download it from the run's **Artifacts** section.

## Install

```
adb install -r CarAmbient-debug.apk
```

## Music access

Showing what's playing needs notification access. If the car's settings screen hides that option, grant it over ADB:

```
adb shell cmd notification allow_listener dev.carapps.ambient/dev.carapps.ambient.MediaListenerService
```
